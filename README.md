# Shopify-Intern-Challenge
This repository is dedicated to the Shopify Data Engineering Intern Challenge Summer 2022.

DIRECTIONS:

Hi there! My name is Nikisha and I created a simple image repository website with an Add image function which also displays the images on the page.
I have added an html file that also includes some javascript code as well as CSS file for style features. 

FUNCTIONS:
ADD Function
- The website will allow you to add any image desired! Just click on "choose files" and you will be allowed to add image formats of JPG, JPEG, PNG etc.

TESTING:
- To test the function, please download index.html and main.css and I've also added a folder called uploads of some cute images that you can use to add onto the repository to make sure it works!
- The images used are all from Google Image search

FUTURE FEATURES:
- I plan on implementing the delete function so that you can delete pictures you don't want on the repository.
- I plan on creating a new user and existing login form so that a user can only view their own images and not those of another person
- I also planned on creating a function that alerts you if you are adding a duplicate image onto your repository
